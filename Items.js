      blog: "Tesla  has received 146,000 reservations to order the Tesla Cybertruck, pulling in some $14.6 million in deposits just two days after the company’s CEO Elon Musk unveiled the futuristic and angled vehicle.Reservations require a $100 refundable deposit. How many of those deposits will convert to actual orders for the truck, which is currently priced between $39,900 and $69,900, is impossible to predict. And there will likely be plenty of speculation over the next two years. Production of the tri-motor variant of the cybertruck is expected to begin in late 2022, Tesla said.Musk tweeted Saturday that 146,000 Cybertruck orders have been made so far. Of those, 41% picked the most expensive tri-motor option and 42% of future customers chose the dual motor version. The remaining 17% picked the cheapest single-motor model The Tesla Cybertruck, which Musk unveiled in dramatic fashion at the Tesla Design Center in Hawthorne, Calif., has been polarizing with skeptics heaping on the criticism and supporters pushing back in kind. Even Tesla fans at the Cybertruck event, which TechCrunch attended, seemed torn with some praising it and others wishing Musk had created something a bit more conventional.The vehicle made of cold-rolled steel and features armored glass that cracked in one demonstration and an adaptive air suspension.Tesla said it will offer three variants of the cybertruck. The cheapest version, a single motor and rear-wheel drive model, will cost $39,900, have a towing capacity of 7,500 pounds and more than 250 miles of range. The middle version will be a dual-motor all-wheel drive, have a towing capacity of more than 10,000 pounds and be able to travel more than 300 miles on a single charge. The dual motor AWD model is priced at $49,900.The third version will have three electric motors and all-wheel drive, a towing capacity of 14,000 pounds and battery range of more than 500 miles. This version, known as “tri motor,” is priced at $69,900..",

      title: "Money Is Changing. Here Are the 3 Most Important Ways It'll Affect the Future of Your Wallet",
      front: "Cryptocurrency is full of opportunities -- and pitfalls. Here are three ways it might transform our lives.",
      blog: "1. No More MiddlemenToday, when it comes to managing our money (or processing just about any transaction), middlemen abound. There are banks, credit card processors, payment platforms, stock exchanges -- the list goes on. Everywhere you look, entities are standing between both sides of every transaction we carry out. And in many cases, one or more of them is taking a cut or charging a fee.Take a credit card transaction, for example. Your credit card issuer (e.g., Chase) and payment processing network (e.g., Visa) manages the transaction. The store where you make a purchase uses a point of sale system (e.g., Square) and pays a transaction fee. That's a lot of cooks in the kitchen for a straightforward exchange of funds to buy something simple like a coffee.With blockchain, those middlemen could disappear. One of blockchain's main features is that it's decentralized -- meaning that you can transact directly with the producer of the item you want to buy, no bank or credit card needed. Transaction fees are no longer a part of the equation. Think about how much money that could put back in your wallet! And more importantly, how much this simplifies the transactions we make -- giving us more clarity into where our dollars go.2. Smart ContractsToday, executing a contract is a rigorous process that involves lawyers and headaches. Think about buying a house. You have brokers, real estate and bank lawyers, the deed company -- the closing process involves a ton of people, and mountains of paperwork (and of course, legal fees).But blockchain can eliminate just about all of it. You don't need all of those records and documents; the blockchain stores all the information. Buying something like a house becomes seamless. Contracts can be automated and direct. By reducing the time it takes to buy and sell, property can suddenly become a more liquid and accessible asset for consumers, pushing transaction costs down, and allowing consumers to more easily tap into their home equity.Blockchain, in other words, takes power out of the hands of institutions and puts it into the hands of the consumer.3. A More Secure, More Streamlined Wallet It's no surprise that so many people fall victim to credit card fraud. We all know that if someone walks into a store and tries to buy something with your credit card, the cashier barely glances at the name on the card, let alone the signature. The company might assume something is fishy and send you a fraud alert -- or perhaps you check your statement a week later and notice that something is wrong. All told, it takes days for a transaction to be tracked and verified as fraudulent, another day or two for your new card (to replace the one you had to cancel) to arrive But all of that could be streamlined with blockchain. Because transaction records are permanent and immutable, there isn't a question about who is involved in a transaction.With blockchain, our phones could store not just our credit cards and passwords, but our medical records and our prescriptions, and even the keys to our car and home. Your identity will be fundamentally managed in one spot.Once these disruptions start to change the way we as individuals interact with money, the next phase will be disruption across industries and society.But while blockchain holds the potential to put more and more power into the hands of individuals, that doesn't mean it's going to be easy. These new technologies are endlessly complex -- but the possibility for innovation is endless, too.Northwestern Mutual is the marketing name for The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company (NM), Milwaukee, WI and its subsidiaries.",

      blog: "The world's movie capital is not Hollywood but Bollywood. Bollywood is the nickname for the Indian film industry located in Bombay (now known as Mumbai, though Mollywood hasn't quite caught on.)Indians are in love with movies, even though most films follow a similar format called masala (the word for a collection of spices). Movies are three to four hours long (and include an intermission), include dozens of songs and dances (featuring 100 or so choreographed dancers), top stars, the story between the songs of boy meets girl (without any kissing or sexual contact), lots of action (though no bloodshed), and always - a happy ending.Fourteen million Indians go to the movies on a daily basis (about 1.4% of the population of 1 billion) and pay the equivalent to the average Indian's day's wages (US $1-3) to see any of the over 800 films churned out by Bollywood each year. That's more than double the number of feature films produced in the United States.Although American-made films have been edging into India, only the blockbuster Titanic has ever made India's top five list. One hundred and fifty U.S. films arrived in India in 1998. However, Indian films have become somewhat of an international obsession.Bollywood films are being shown in American and British theaters on a more and more frequent basis. These theaters have become community foci for the South Asian communities around the world. Though separated by a vast distance from home, South Asians have found Bollywood films to be a great way of staying in touch with their culture and their fellow South Asians.Since India is a country of sixteen official languages and a total of twenty-four languages spoken by over a million people each, some portions of the film industry are fragmented. While Mumbai (Bollywood) leads India in film production, its specialty lies with Hindi movies. Chennai (formerly Madras) produces films in Tamil and Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) is the Bengali movie capital. Neighboring Pakistan's Lahore calls itself Lollywood.Bollywood's film production center is a government-owned studio facility known as 'Film City' in the northern suburbs of Mumbai. Bollywood traces its start to 1911 when the first silent Indian feature film was released by D.P. Phalke. The industry boomed and today there are over 250 theaters in Mumbai alone.The stars of Bollywood are very popular and highly paid, considering the budget of the films. The lead star in a film often receives as much as 40% of the US $2 million budget for the typical masala film. Stars may be in such high demand that they're working on ten films at once. Photographs of Bollywood stars grace shop windows and homes throughout the country.Providing three to four hours of escapism is the primary objective of Bollywood and it's a recipe done well. Indian movies are becoming more and more popular around the world so watch for them in theaters and video stores near you.",
